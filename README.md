# Personal GitHub Cloud ☁️

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository!  
I'm a university student using this space as a personal cloud to store, manage, and back up my files and projects.

## 📁 What you'll find here

- Class notes and assignments 📝  
- Code snippets and practice projects 💻  
- Personal documents and backups 📂  
- Ideas, plans, and creative experiments 💡  

## ⚙️ Why I use GitHub

Using GitHub as my cloud helps me:
- Keep track of changes over time with version control
- Access my files from anywhere, anytime
- Stay organized and focused

Feel free to look around — but this is mostly for my personal use! 😄
